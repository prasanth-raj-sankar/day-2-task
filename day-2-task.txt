1.	write a blog on difference between document and window objects

Window Object:
•	The Window object is a global object in client-side JavaScript, representing the browser window containing a DOM document and acting as the root of the document object model.
•	The window object, supported by all browsers, represents the browser’s window and automatically includes global JavaScript objects, functions, and variables as members.
•	The Window object is responsible for managing global variables, functions, and objects

Document Object :
•	The Document object is the HTML document that appears in the browser window and serves as an interface for interacting with the web page’s content.
•	The browser generates a Document Object Model of a web page upon loading it.
•	It represents the entire HTML document as a node tree, with the Document object as the root node. It allows dynamic updates and interactions with web page content.
